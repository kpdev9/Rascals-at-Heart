    So, how was that?

    Enough romance for you?

    Of course, seeing the state that the story was told in made it out to be pretty imperfect.

    In this reality, our protagonist and her lovely companion will live their lives to the best of their abilities.

    However, this is only one of several alternate realities that we could find these characters entering into.

    I bet it would be one reality that the companion may have wished she could grasp, but alas, reality is not so forgiving, even beyond in this sea of fragments.

    I'm sure you may know this by now, but she is fighting for her true happy ending, probably going somewhere along the lines as this.

    Sure, it may be somewhat imperfect, but it would certainly be ideal in her eyes, if it would mean anything to not be in that other scenario, I suppose.

    Until then, she will keep on fighting, but for now, we can bid a farewell to this fragment, it certainly was interesting to observe.

    Who knows, we might make another worthwhile discovery...

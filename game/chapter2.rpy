    "As expected, Keiichi, Rena and Mion showed up. I promptly explained my predicament to them."

    k "Alright, so let me get this straight,"

    extend " You seemed to have fallen in love with Satoko and now you are asking us for advice on relationships."
    
    extend " Is that right?"

    r "Meep. That's it."

    k "Right, well..."

    extend " It might be because I'm a boy, but I don't really get how you could fall for someone like Satoko."

    k "Isn't she a girl? I thought you would actually be falling for Okamura for once."

    re "Keiichi, you shouldn't say stuff like that,"

    extend " Rika should feel free to fall in love with anyone she rightfully desires. Hau."

    m "That's right, Rena,"

    extend " I'm not sure if my family are fine with this type of relationship, but personally, I don't really mind that much about it."

    k serious "Huh, you guys are right."
    
    extend " I guess I will have to tell Tomita and Okamura the bad news."

    "I couldn't help but think that the idea Keiichi brought up seemed awful, yet humorous."

    m cheeky "Heheh, I'll allow that, Kei-chan."
    
    m neutral "Right now, however, we have a more important matter to discuss. So, any ideas?"

    re neutral "Oh, I know!"
    
    extend " I would just ask them out on a trip to somewhere I would be most familiar with."

    re happy "For example, I would take Keiichi out with me to the junkyard for a picnic atop my secret hideout. Hehe."

    k suspicious "Woah, hey, I thought we were going out as friends!"
    
    k "You said it yourself, they were just friendly picnics you invited me to because you felt generous."

    re happy arms 1 "Well yeah, that is the reason I invited you, I was just saying it as an example."
    
    re "Although... if you want, we could... Hauuuuu~."

    k "Urgh, I'll think about it."

    show rena flustered arms
    show keiichi serious

    "Rena became her flustered self once Keiichi uttered that sentence. I swear that Keiichi was shuddering in fear at that moment."

    m happy "Rena is right,"
    
    extend " girls love a good scenic trip where they could sit and chat with you."

    m cheeky "That probably explains some of Keiichi's regular visits to Angel Mort."

    k suspicious "Oioi, why me again?"
    
    extend " Geez, I feel like I'm being targeted."

    k "If you're saying that, then there's probably something that you're not telling me, hmm?"

    m wink "I may not be saying it, but it could be that I'm inferring it."

    m neutral "Anyway, before I get too off subject, there is something else that you could do to get to Satoko's heart:"
    
    extend " every girl would like a little gift as a token of appreciation."

    m happy "Just like when Kei-san gave me that doll that one."
    
    extend " By the way, I really appreciated that, Keiichi."

    k confused "U-um yeah, no problem I guess."

    re happy arms 2 "Hauu, that's right!"
    
    extend " Girls love gifts, just the type of thing that they could take home and think about you all day with and... and... haauuu~."

    k neutral 1 "Yeah, a gift is a great idea actually."
    
    extend " Heck, you two are conveniently living together, so this will be easy to organize."
    
    k "No need to unexpectedly come up to each other's houses and what not."

    m "Exactly! This will be a piece of cake, I just know it!"

    r "Wow, thank you for all the nice suggestions. Meep."
    
    r "Although, I'm not sure if that is enough to help me impress Satoko."
    
    extend " What if she doesn't like that kind of stuff?"

    k neutral 2 "Hey, Rika. You're both still pretty young,"

    extend " I'm sure you could be impressed by anything at your ages."

    k "Even then, if you need more advise, I bet the villagers - heck, even some of our other pals would be able to give out some suggestions, for instance-"

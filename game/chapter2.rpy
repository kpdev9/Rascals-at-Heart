    extend " You seemed to have fallen in love with Satoko and now you are asking us for advice on relationships."
    
    extend " Is that right?"

    r "Meep. That's it."

    k "Right, well..."

    extend " It might be because I'm a boy, but I don't really get how you could fall for someone like Satoko."

    k "Isn't she a girl? I thought you would actually be falling for Okamura for once."

    k serious "Huh, you guys are right."
    
    extend " I guess I will have to tell Tomita and Okamura the bad news."

    "I couldn't help but think that the idea Keiichi brought up seemed awful, yet humorous."

    k suspicious "Woah, hey, I thought we were going out as friends!"
    
    k "You said it yourself, they were just friendly picnics you invited me to because you felt generous."

    re happy arms 1 "Well yeah, that is the reason I invited you, I was just saying it as an example."

    extend " girls love a good scenic trip where they could sit and chat with you."

    k suspicious "Oioi, why me again?"
    
    extend " Geez, I feel like I'm being targeted."

    k "If you're saying that, then there's probably something that you're not telling me, hmm?"

    m wink "I may not be saying it, but it could be that I'm inferring it."

    extend " every girl would like a little gift as a token of appreciation."

    m happy "Just like when Kei-san gave me that doll that one time."
    
    extend " By the way, I really appreciated that, Keiichi."

    k confused "U-um yeah, no problem I guess."

    re happy arms 2 "Hauu, that's right!"
    
    extend " Girls love gifts, just the type of thing that they could take home and think about you all day with and... and... haauuu~."

    k neutral 1 "Yeah, a gift is a great idea actually."
    
    extend " Heck, you two are conveniently living together, so this will be easy to organize."
    
    k "No need to unexpectedly come up to each other's houses and what not."

    m "Exactly! This will be a piece of cake, I just know it!"

    r "Wow, thank you for all the nice suggestions. Meep."
    
    r "Although, I'm not sure if that is enough to help me impress Satoko."
    
    extend " What if she doesn't like that kind of stuff?"

    k neutral 2 "Hey, Rika. You're both still pretty young,"

    extend " I'm sure you could be impressed by anything at your ages."

    sh neutral arm "Sure, all the suggestions that have been thrown around just now seem like great suggestions, but I bet this will take great preparation."

    extend " That is, if they would even know anything about this in the first place."

    "Not only that, she appears... flustered?"

    "Even last night, Rika seemed a little closer to me than usual,"

    "I could only hypothesise what all this really meant."

    "Oh my, perhaps my emotions..."

    extend " are also getting a bit mixed up too."

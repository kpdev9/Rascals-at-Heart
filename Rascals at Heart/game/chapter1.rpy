    We've never seen the supermarket this packed before!
    
    I had no idea, but Satoko told me that a huge sale was happening, and they were giving away free stuff with every purchase.
    
    Both of us knew that this was a deal that we couldn't miss.
    
    No wonder Satoko was in such a hurry today. I've really got to learn how I could possibly get this much intel so quickly.
    
    Now that I think about it, it is the beginning of July, I can see why that would be the case, with it taking advantage of the season.

    With the events that had happened only weeks ago, it's no wonder that Satoko had been thinking about her traps all this time.

    Tonight, we were going to treat ourselves with a wonderful curry dinner. We never usually have curry, so this will be a special occasion.

    I have to make sure it will be perfect, so I will be picking out the ingredients. Satoko was still learning, yet she is getting better by the day. I'm impressed!

    In all of my years of being with her, it's always been a joy to get in on her antics.
    
    She is so full of energy and makes any day brighter with her sweet smile. What a lovely girl to hang out with.

    It's no surprise that I enjoy my time with Satoko very often.
    
    I have been great friends with her since the Dam Conflict; I've been there for her whenever she needs it and I made sure that she didn't get hurt too much.

    It was clear when the going got tough that there were some restrictions on meeting her.
    
    She was horribly abused by her aunt - and in some worlds, her uncle too - but it all cleared up in the end.

    I remember how I had lost all hope whenever that scenario appears in the world I'm in.
    
    In that world where we reigned over that one hurdle in my life, as Hanyuu put it, I was so happy to see her free once again, able to roam without any harm from even the villagers.
    
    I could imagine myself joyous for her return. That must've been where I truly learned that you could break fate.

    Although, maybe I have to admit: I really did miss her during those times. It was really depressing living alone like that.
    
    I mean, how could I possibly live without having to lose anyone? How could I possibly live without my friends?

    How could I possibly live without her?

    How could I possibly live without Satoko?
